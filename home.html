<h2>Housing prices are a real crisis in America!</h2>
        <p>Record-breaking numbers of families cannot afford a decent place to call home:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nationally, there is a shortage of more than 7 million affordable homes for our nation's 11 million plus extremely low-income families. </li>
            <li>There is no state or county where a renter working full-time at minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment.</li>
            <li>Seventy-five percent of all extremely low-income families are severely cost-burdened, paying more than half their income on rent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a problem! Every state and every community is impacted. 
            Families have few options. Each year the shortage gets worse; 
            and thatâ€™s why people are homeless in our country 
            and why families struggle to pay for groceries and visits to their doctor.</p>
